# HAN

Implementation of the HAN network architecture proposed by AUTHORS in https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08767.

The original network has over 30M parameters. To speed up training and reduce filesizes, the network was built with fewer residual attention blocks.

## How it works

The network was trained using 96x96 patches from the DIV2K dataset. During training for the 2x super resolution, the network uses a 48x48 patch size as input and outputs a 96x96 patch trying to recover the original input.

## Results
Peak signal to noise ratio and structural similarity for the
